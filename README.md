# scripter
This project is a Flask-based web application that allows users to browse, configure, and execute Python scripts via a modern Bootstrap UI. It introspects functions to auto-generate forms with type validation and default values, dispatches commands to a subprocess, and streams real-time logs back to the browser. Users can share scripts.!
